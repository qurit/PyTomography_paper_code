The following repository contains all the code for the paper published at LINK. 

* `simind_part_<>` contains code pertaining to reconstruction of SIMIND data
* `dicom_part_<>` contains code pertaining to reconstruction of DICOM data
* `pet_part1` contains code pertaining to PET simulation/reconstruction.
* `recon_script.py` and `simind_part3.py` are additional python scripts used for `simind_part3_analysis.ipynb`. This was needed due to the fact that many reconstructions were performed.

All data used in the scripts can be found at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c7QAV5GuEXZ9CyIxf1mAoNclehAxnQj4/view?usp=sharing)
